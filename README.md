## About the Project
A Scala implementation of the board-game **Malefiz**  
Malefiz is a widely used board game by [Ravensburger](https://www.ravensburger.de/start/index.html) and was created in 1959 by Werner Sch√∂ppner

## Purpose of the Project
The project was developed in the context of the lecture "Software Engineering" at the University of Applied Science Konstanz, Germany. (WS 17/18)  
The goal of this project was to learn and apply these following components:

* version control with git
* layered architecture
* design patterns

This implementation comes along with a *TUI* (textual user interface) and *GUI* (graphical user interface).
